the wackiest of algorithms that you won't ever need

## algorithms

### bogosort
To sort a list, just shuffle it till entropy finds its way to order. Its name is a portmanteau of the words bogus and sort.

### sleepsort

To sort a list, it spawns a coroutine for each element that sleeps for the element's value, in seconds (times a multiplier for reducing wait time). The order the coroutines print in will be in sorted order, _almost always_&trade;.
